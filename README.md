### ARIMA Benchmark
- run benchmarks/aerobench/arima_benchmark.py 
- run 20 trials of the F16 flight simulator
- use an ARIMA model to predict the altitude of the aircraft
- evaluate each model based on the RMSE
- RMSEs of each trial saved in benchmarks/aerobench/arima_benchmark_results.csv


### LSTM Benchmark
- run benchmarks/aerobench/lstm_benchmark.py
- run 20 trials of the F16 flight simulator
- use LSTM model to predict altitude of aircraft
- evaluate each model based on RMSE
- RMSEs of each trial saved in benchmarks/aerobench/LSTM_benchmark_results.csv
