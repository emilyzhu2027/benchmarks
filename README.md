### ARIMA Benchmark
1. run arima-benchmark/aerobench/arima_benchmark_f16gcas.py
- this will run 2000 trials of the F16 flight simulator, where the initial parameters are randomized, and use an ARIMA model to predict the altitude of the aircraft. for each trial, it will output some plots and evaluate each model based on the RMSE. the RMSEs of each trial will then be saved in arima-benchmark/aerobench/arima_results.csv.
